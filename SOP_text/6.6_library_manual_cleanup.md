## Purpose/Scope: ##
Protocol written for 48 samples

This SOP describes the steps used by NASA GeneLab for manually cleaning Illumina TruSeq Total RNA libraries of adapter dimers.

## Reagents: ##
1.	RSB (Resuspension buffer) from Illumina TruSeq total RNA (Ribo Gold)
2.	3x 96-well half skirted plates
3.	AMPure XP reagent (Beckman Coulter cat#A63882/A638880/A63881)
4.	Multi-channel pipettes 
5.	Rod magnetic stand 
6.	Liquid reservoirs 

## Procedure: ##
**_Make sure the AMPure beads and RSB buffer were equilibrated to room temperature for 30min prior beginning the procedure._**

1.	Bring all wells to a final volume of 50uL by addition of appropriate volume of RSB.
2.	Using a multi-channel pipette and a reservoir, add 50uL of AMPure beads in to all library wells. (1X SPRI clean up). Seal the plate.
3.	Vortex using the heat-block or a plate vortexer at 1800 RPM for 2 minutes.
4.	Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes.
5.	Quick spin the plate and carefully open the plate seal.
6.	Place plate on a magnetic rod stand and incubate for 5 minutes or until the liquid is clear. 
7.	Remove the supernatant. 
8.	Without removing plate from magnetic stand, wash two times as follows:
  a.	 Using a multi-channel pipette, add 200uL of fresh (<24HR old) EtOH to each well.
  b.	 Incubate for 30 seconds.
  c.	Remove and discard all supernatant from each well. 
9.	Use a 20uL multi-channel pipette to remove residual EtOH from each well.
10.	Air-dry on the magnetic stand for 7-10min. Check for “coffee bean appearance”, avoid over drying. 
11.	Remove plate from the magnetic stand. 
12.	Using a multi-channel pipette and a reservoir, add 30uL of RSB in to each well, seal the plate. 
13.	Vortex using the heat-block or a plate vortexer at 1800 RPM for 2 minutes.
14.	Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes.
15.	Quick spin the plate and carefully open the plate seal.
16.	Place the plate on a magnetic stand for 5 minutes. 
17.	Transfer 30uL of supernatant into clean wells.
